- When loading a module, kickstart needs to keep the multiboot
  data to generate the bootinfo structure later on
  (look for orig_mbi_modules).
  Instead, it could extract the information during module loading
  and reuse the original modules as free memory, avoid memory
  region conflicts.

- Some memory region conflicts are resolvable by moving data to a
  temporary location. The current version bails out if the kernel
  must be copied onto itself, for example.
